The aim of this project is to build an example conversational chat bot that that uses features such dialogs, rich cards and adaptive cards, to help users find information about live coding streamers on platforms such as Twitch. The bot is being developed live on my stream [Codebase Alpha](https://twitch.tv/codebasealpha) as part of a series of shows invesigating the [Microsoft Bot Framework][1]. The project started with the EchoBot template, and is gradually adding features, including any code migrations required or recommended for the latest version of the Bot Framework. Currently, we are using the v4.4.2 Nuget packages.

I am learning the Framework alongside my viewers, and so at any point in time, the code will be working, but will be in various stages of development or migration to the latest structural recommendations. We will add advanced features, such as AI, natural language recognition, and so forth, as their need is identified during the life of the project.

Follow me on Twitter `@codebasealpha` and on Twitch (at the above URL) to be notified when my next stream will be broadcast.
